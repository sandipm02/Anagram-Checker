          Hi There! Welcome to 
        Sandip's Anagram Checker!

=========================================
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
=========================================

Thank you for checking this project out! 
Essentially this program will allow users 
to input two words and tell them if these 
two words are Anagrams!

**Anagrams: A word or phrase formed by 
rearranging the letters of a different word 
or phrase, typically using all the original 
letters exactly once. 

The program is Case-Sensitive, meaning that 
if you are to input the words Car and car. 
The program would return false. Keep this in 
mind!
